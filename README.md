# About

This is a pure JavaScript implementation of a Xerox Alto emulator.
This project is more or less a straight port of the Living Computer
Museum's "ContrAlto" emulator from .Net / C# to JavaScript.

The end goal is a usable, performant Xerox Alto emulator running in
your web browser.

# Status

This code is incomplete and in active development. It is NOT YET
USABLE.

# Credits

This project would not have been possible without The Living Computer Museum's
[ContrAlto](https://github.com/livingcomputermuseum/ContrAlto) project, of
which this is a direct port. The architecture and design is theirs; I merely
translated the project from C# to JavaScript.
